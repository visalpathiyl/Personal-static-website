              <p class=" mt-3 text-justify"> Sanal Kumar Sasidharan wrote and directed A'hr, also known as Kayattam, which stars Manju Warrier, Bhupendra Khurana, Gaurav Ravindran, and others. <br><br>


                Maya, the protagonist, refers to the greater mystery of the universe and its masterful manipulation of human minds. The mystic story is revealed during a Himalayan climb. <br><br>
                
                
                This film, like Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's previous works, is a mystery that depends on the audience's perspective. Kayattam is a completely art film with no room for entertainment. 
                Manju Warrier's character Maya was portrayed as mysterious in the film's trailer. The definition of the word Maya will also be shown at the beginning of the film. So, from the start, 
                a rapo will be created in the audience's mind in order for them to accept and understand Maya. As I previously stated, there are numerous elements and dialogues that highlight Maya's 
                mysterious nature. Maya doesn't have a specific characterization, but the process of writing her character makes her much more mysterious and intense. Her past or any other information 
                about her will not be revealed throughout the film. However, some hints for the audience will be provided through dialogues and conversations. It was like a puzzle, with viewers having 
                to match each clue from different parts of the film in order to understand her character and the film as a whole. Other characters in the film will be given equal screen time, but their 
                roles will be simple. <br><br>
                
                His direction also enhances the film's beauty and intensity. This film is about a group of travellers who are on their way to the Himalayas. As a result, the entire film is shot in the style 
                of a travel diary. In addition, this film was entirely shot on an iPhone. In terms of story telling, Sanal Kumar Sasidharan has used songs in his film to convey what happens next or what each 
                character's current state of mind is. I admire the way he shot the film because, while the storey was simple, the way he designed each scene to convey each character was fantastic, and he also 
                wanted the audience to understand the story from each frame rather than from the spoon feeding concept. It is entirely a visual experience in which the story and character of Maya are concealed. <br><br>
                
                Manju Warrier and Vedh's performances are more prominent in the film. Manju Warrier's performance as Maya was enjoyable because she seemed at ease in the role. Maya became  beautiful and perfect 
                character as a result of this. Vedh, on the other hand, was excellent. He could also perform in such a way that the audience dislikes his character. Other artists in the film did an excellent job 
                as well. <br><br>
                
                Selvaraj Chandru's cinematography enhanced the visuals. As previously stated, this film was entirely shot on an iPhone, but the audience has no idea. There are also some close-up shots that are quite 
                lovely and reveal the characters' current state. <br><br>
                
                
                Sanal Kumar Sasidharan also did the editing, which was very smooth and the transitions were very cool. Maya's character becomes much more intense towards the end of the film. <br><br>
                
                
                Ratheesh Eettillam's music adds to the film's rawness while also making it adorable. <br><br>
                
                Through this film, Sanal created a completely intense and mysterious character named Maya.   Aside from his story, I was very impressed with his direction. The way he told the storey through visual storytelling.
                I was completely stunned and blank when I exited the theatre. It took some time for me to understand the character Maya. A conversation with Maya and Vedh will take place near the end.
                There will be a transition to unimaginative visuals in between their conversations. It is entirely up to the audience to determine what occurred. As a result,  Kayattam is a film that varies depending on the audience. <br><br>
