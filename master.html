                <img src="master.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="" width="70%" height="50%">
              <p class=" mt-3 text-justify">Lokesh Kanakaraj wrote and directed the Tamil film Master, which stars Vijay, Vijay Sethupathi, Malavika Mohanan, Arjun Das, and Andrea Jeremiah. It was the first film to be released in the Tamil film industry following the covid pandemic.
                <br> <br> A college professor who is an alcoholic had some problems at his college and was sentenced to a juvenile home, where he will fight a gangster who uses children in his criminal activities. <br> <br>
                Lokesh Kanakaraj is a well-known director and screenwriter best known for his work on the films "Maanagaram" and "Kaithi." Both of these films belonged to a different genre. But the thing that connects or is similar to both of them is a reference to Kamal Hassan. The protagonist in "Maanagaram" resembles Kamal Hassan's character in "Satya," a 1988 Tamil film, while the protagonist Dhilli in "Kaithi," a 2019 Tamil film, resembles Kamal Hassan's character in "Virumandi," a 2014 Tamil film. We could see Kamal Hassan's shades in Lokesh's films because he is a Kamal Hassan fanboy.
In "Master," the protagonist JD was also referred to as Prof. Selva's student, a role played by Kamal Hassan in the 1995 film "Nammavar." Similarly, Lokesh Kanakaraj's films were too different. His writing process varies between his three films. In "Maanagaram," the two main characters have opposing perspectives and ideologies at first, but this diminishes by the end. In "Kaithi," there is a structure in which the entire story is related to three main characters at the beginning, and then at the end, a new character who has a connection with the protagonist is introduced.
 This opens the door to its sequel. The structure of "Master" is completely different from the previous two. Every scene here is a contrast between the protagonist and the antagonist. To show the audience how powerful the villain is and how powerless the hero is.
 </p>
                 <p class=" mt-3 text-justify">Not only is Lokesh Kanakaraj's screenwriting exceptional, but so is his direction. In Kaithi, there is a scene where the camera moves from the back of the lorry to its interior and then to the next one.
                    Also, I believe everyone enjoys the biriyani scene. Similarly, he has several details for both the protagonist and the antagonist in "Master." They can be distinguished based on what they wear and their ideologies. Both Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi delivered stellar performances. Vijay's screen presence was excessive, and his performance in the "vaathi coming" song made it a banger af. The emotional scene in the jail was also good, but I didn't feel it as strongly as I did in his own emotional scenes in "Kaththi" and "Shajahan." Aside from that, I could see him struggling in some of the scenes. Especially the emotional scenes in jail between JD and Charu. The villain, Bhavani, is played with ease by Vijay Sethupathi. As I previously stated about Vijay's screen presence, Vijay Sethupathi's screen presence was also lit. Particularly in both of their combined scenes. 
                    And Arjun Das has a Dolby Atmos system inside his throat. His appearances in "Master" and "Kaithi" are diametrically opposed. His performance and voice were also well-balanced. Poovaiyar, Shanthnu, Gowri Lekshmi, Andrea Jeremiah, Malavika Mohanan, and others played their parts convincingly despite their limited screen presence.
                    
                  <br>  <br> Anirudh is the man behind the album of "Master." His music adds a lot of entertainment value to the film. The soul of "Master" is "Vaathi coming." The film's ost was also illuminated. <br><br>
                
                  "Master's" cinematographer is Sathyan Sooryan. His cinematography styles elevate "Master" to a higher level of entertainment for all audiences. "Kaithi," "Theeran Adhigaram Ondru," and "Adangamaru" are among his previous works. <br><br>
                  Philomin Raj, the editor of "Master," plays a critical role in the success of the novel. As I previously stated, its structure is a type of comparison, so comparisons were made much smoother. <br><br>Master is more than just an entertaining film; its writing process is also very different from that of other commercial films. Both the hero and the villain are compared from the beginning. The similar kind of writing process was done in the malayalam movie "The Great Indian Kitchen" released in 2020, there too both male and female leads in the movie will be compared consequtevily. We can easily understand their capabilities and weaknesses even based on the way they dress. Bhavani is a person who believes that drinking alcohol will bring you trouble. JD, on the other hand, is an alcoholic.
                  Throughout the first half, Bhavani will be portrayed as cunning, steady, and so on, while JD is portrayed as the polar opposite of Bhavani. All of JD's scenes with Bhavani were the same. The only difference is that the characters have changed.
                  As a result, their intention was to simply compare both of them. During the intermission, Bhavani will also murder all of his enemies in order to enter politics. JD does not have any enemies at the time, but after the interval, they both become enemies to each other.
                  Most of the fight scenes in this movie are normal and there isn't any kind of exageration to that character. In most of the fight scenes, JD even become tired within no time.  <br><br>
                  There are numerous other aspects of this film that I enjoyed. The manner in which the storey is told, the structure of the screenplay, the performances, the characterisations, the music, and so on. There will also be a reference to each of the things that both the hero and the villain do, such as JD using his kada to defeat Bhavani, which will be used early in the intermission scene. Likewise, the reason for Bhavani's strength of hand. <br><br>
