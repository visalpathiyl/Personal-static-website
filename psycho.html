                Gautham, a blind man who has fallen in love with Dhakini, a radio jockey, must persuade her. Unfortunately, he becomes involved in a murder mystery perpetrated by a serial killer.

               Psycho is a thriller film based on the story of Budhist and Angulimala. Angulimala used to wear people's fingers as a chain, which is how he got his name; the serial killer here has 
               the same habit. Psycho is unlike any other psychological thriller film. There are no exciting moments here. In fact, contrary to other psycho killer films,  the killer will be revealed 
              right away in this case. There is a conversation between two women at the beginning of the film that gives a hint as to who the serial killer in this film is. Because this is an adaptation 
              of the storey Budhist and the Angulimala, each of the characters' names indicates their specific role. There are also specific elements surrounding all of these characters that define their 
              behaviour as well as their names.  The serial killer played the Budhist roles of Dhakini and Angulimala. The entire film will be read aloud like a poem, describing the killer's emotions. 
              The story is written from the perspective of the antagonist. There is a transition for the killer character between before and after meeting Dhakini. This will be demonstrated in a few scenes. 
              In this case, the killer's characterization and writing process justify his mindset. <br><br>
              
              Myshkin's direction elevated the film's artistic value. There is one scene in particular where the killer describes his past or the reasons why he became like this. It was like a one-man show 
              with only two people watching him. The first person represents the person in charge, while the second person represents the audience or God. As previously stated, Myshkin has a firm grasp on 
              his characters and their needs. The performances of the characters in the majority of the scenes indicate a type of drama. The film is shot entirely in black and white, especially for the killer.
              As previously stated, it is an adaptation of the Angulimala story, which is reflected throughout the film. Most of his creative designs, such as arranging the skulls in a triangle shape and the killer 
              bathing naked with his head facing downwards, indicate how much the killer enjoys and admires the process. Throughout the film, he was able to create an intense and dark atmosphere. <br><br>
              
              Udhayanidhi Stalin played Gautham well, but I wouldn't say it was his best performance to date. Sakthi in Manithan was, in my opinion, his best performance. Aditi, as Dhakini, played a significant role 
              in the film as I previously stated. She was also just in that regard. Nithya Menen and the other artists also did an excellent job. Rajkumar Pitchumani, who played the assassin, nailed it. Actually, his 
              performance occupies a separate space in the film, making it a perfect serial killer film. <br><br>

              Illayaraja's music adds a lot of intensity to the film and keeps it true to itself as an art form. Several scenes in the film use only his OST to create a horror-like atmosphere for the audience. The song 
              "Unna Ninachu Ninachu" was dominating the film, and the lyrics by Kabilan defines Gautham's love for Dhakini. <br><br>
              
              Tanveer Mir's fantastic visuals elevate Psycho to new heights. From the teaser to the trailer to the film, his visuals speak for themselves and add to the story. The lighting in the film, in particular, was 
              overly lit in order to highlight the villain's dark side. And, thanks to his visuals and lighting, even the night appears as beautiful as the heroines in Gautham Vasudev Menon's film. <br><br>

              N. Arunkumar, the editor, created a smooth process and transitions that resulted in an enjoyable and easy-to-watch film Psycho. <br><br>

              The way Myshkin wrote each character set the film apart from other thrillers. Particularly the assassin. Not only that, but Myshkin's perspective on the serial killer astounded me.
              There is a dialogue in the climax that justifies the killer character. I saw the entire film as a journey deep inside the killer's character. We will have a single point of view and opinion about him at first. 
              And by the end, everything will be completely different. Myshkin's shots, Tanveer's individual frames, Illayaraja music, and Rajkumar Pitchumani's performance all contributed to the film's success. <br> <br>
              What I believe the movie's negatives were was that it made an impression on each and every audience as a kind of dark, intense, and seat-edged thriller movie from its poster to teaser to trailer. Unfortunately, 
              there were no scenes that gave the audience goosebumps. But, as I previously stated, it is a film that explores the killer in order to make people understand him rather than to make them excited about his actions.
